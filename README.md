## Project Name and Description
Goal planner is an app enables us to plan our todo list and doing it in a weekly calendar. Moreover, the app has an specific page for user to write about her/his passion like a journal. (have to be more specific in this part)

## MVP Goals
***Frontend:*** 
Components 
- Navbar
- Landing page (screens) for login/registration
- Homepage (screens)
- Journal Page (screens)
- Todo list/ Form for todo list
- Planner entry
- Passion journal entries
- Weekly Reflection (5 things that went well this week/proud of)
***Backend:***
- Routes
- Controllers
- Seed files
- Models (userSchema, plannerEntrySchema, toDoSchema, journalSchema (these Schemas will reference the user model, rather than having to embed it))
- Database (passionPlannerDB)
- Server.js

## Post-MVP Goals
- Motivational quotes (component using API possibly)
- Dark mode
- Notification (email users and remind them)

## Database Schemas
_Please provide a sample of how you intend to build your models. A Schema object for each of your models is ideal._

```json

```

## Whimsical
_Please post your application's full stack diagram here as an IMAGE, not as a link._

## Wireframes
_For each screen you intend on showing, provide a wireframe for both desktop and mobile._

## Timeframes
_Use the table below to create your team's timeframes. Given the project is about a week long, you can add between 40 hours * group members (i.e. 120 hours for 3 group members)._

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |
