## Project Name and Description
Goal Planner - a planner designed to help you achieve your goals, reflect on your week, journal, and more!

## MVP Goals
***Frontend:*** 
Components 
- Navbar
- Landing page (screens) for login/registration
- Homepage (screens)
- Journal Page (screens)
- Todo list/ Form for todo list
- Planner entry
- Passion journal entries
- Weekly Reflection (5 things that went well this week/proud of)
***Backend:***
- Routes
- Controllers
- Seed files
- Models (userSchema, plannerEntrySchema, toDoSchema, journalSchema (these Schemas will reference the user model, rather than having to embed it))
- Database (passionPlannerDB)
- Server.js

## Post-MVP Goals
- Motivational quotes (component using API possibly)
- Dark mode
- Notification (email users and remind them)

## Database Schemas
_Please provide a sample of how you intend to build your models. A Schema object for each of your models is ideal._

```json

```

## SWOT Analysis
***Lynne:***
- Strengths: I believe my strongest strength is CSS. It’s something I do enjoy doing and it brings out the creative side in me. Although it still challenges me, it helps me become stronger at it.
- Weaknesses: React and back end in general are my weaknesses. I think it’s something I need to continue practicing and working on. I know I have to put in the extra work to get it but practicing and making mistakes will help me learn. This project will help me do that.
- Opportunities: I have the opportunity to work on a group project with my colleagues. It may not be my first time working in a group but working together on web developing will be a great learning experience and will help me grow to prepare me for the future.
- Threats: I wouldn’t necessarily say having to work in a group is a complete threat but it will definitely be a challenge. Not every one of us have the same methods and possibly won’t agree on everything but we get to learn from each other and that’s more of a benefit than a pain point. Also the back-end side will be the biggest threat to me.

***Kiana:*** 
- Strengths: React
- Weaknesses: mongoose, testing
- Opportunities: I can use this as an opportunity to get better at backend (mongoDB) and testing. I think this is  agood -opportunity to experience coding in a group environment.
- Threats: Working ina group presents new challenges!

***Herman:***
- Strengths: Backend mongoDB, color palettes
- Weaknesses:  testing, some part of frontend functionality
- Opportunities: learning about react calendar package and back-end functionality
- Threats: testing backend endpoints and connecting models and seeds

***Moty:***
- Strengths: React 
- Weaknesses: testing
- Opportunities: learning about react calendar package and trying to do testing in this project for the dark mode 
- Threats:  I am a bit behind in assignments (not learning the backend stuff properly)
